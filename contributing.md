# Steps for contributing code

## Fork this repository

[Fork this repo](https://github.com/publikphigor/dyor) by clicking on the Fork option.<br>

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository on your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" is the url to your fork of this project. See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Gitpic.git
```

where `YOUR-USERNAME` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
Run `cd dyor`
```

Now create a branch using the `git branch` command:

```
Run `git branch <new_branch_name>`
```

Here, you can try and keep branch name as the number of issue you are trying to solve i.e `issue_1` <br>

Checkout to the new branch so you can push onto the new branch of the forked repository

```
git checkout <new_branch_name>
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "anything that expresses whatever changes you have made"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <new_branch_name>
```

replacing `<new_branch_name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

Now you are ready to make a pull request. Go to the forked repo on Github under your profile and a click on the `Compare & pull request` button. You will be taken to a page where you can create a pull request.
When creating a PR, add the linked issue in the description. For example : "Closes #1" if the issue you have resolved is issue #1.
<br>

## Once done with all this

Wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged if approved.
Congratulations! You've made a Contribution.
